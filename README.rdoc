This app is meant to help local theatre directors, music directors, and
choreographers keep track of portfolios of actors and musicians who audition
for their productions. The app will let creative directors keep and organize
private notes. They will also be able to securely request and share data about 
specific actors with other directors who request the notes. The feedback
will consist of free-form writing and also ratings of actors and musicians
in certain categories. The app will help the tight knit local community 
of creative directors to better organize their notes (instead of relying
on pen and paper) and request information about actors/musicians auditioning
for their productions from other directors the actors/musicians have worked with.
